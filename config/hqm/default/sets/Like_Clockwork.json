To change the direction it sends items during crafting, simply right-click the front of the crafter with a Wrench. In a setup, the crafters can be automatically filled by Funnels or Hoppers, and they can share inventories without being part of the same crafting recipe. A Wrench can also be used on the back and sides of Mechanical Crafters to connect or disconnect adjacent crafters\u0027 inventories. Items can be manually inserted or removed as well.\n\nEach Mechanical Crafter requires rotational power from either adjacent crafters or any size Cogwheel. This means that only one crafter in a setup needs to be powered by a Cogwheel for the entire system to work. Once powered, and when all the crafting slots are filled or a redstone signal is received, the Mechanical Crafters will send their items to adjacent crafters. To successfully craft an item, the components must eventually meet in one crafter, where they will turn into the final product. Crafter Slot Covers can act as empty spaces in a recipe, allowing for the connection of separate crafters, but they do not move the items themselves.\n\nIf the items do not form a valid recipe, the crafters will eject the items instead of crafting the product. For automating crafting, directly adjacent slots can be merged to hold a single item type, like andesite alloy. This allows the material to be fed in from the side via a hopper, streamlining the crafting process. Powered Mechanical Crafters will start crafting once all slots are filled or when a redstone signal is applied.",

They can both insert into and extract from inventories positioned directly above or below, and when connected vertically or diagonally, they automatically pass items between each other. By default, items fall through chutes due to gravity, but upward movement is possible using encased fans positioned either above (to pull) or below (to push), with fan speed determining the rate of item transport. Chutes also support complex logistics through merging and splitting. Multiple chute lines can converge, though items won’t combine into single stacks. In fan-powered setups, item routing follows basic preferences: pushing fans prioritize straight paths, while pulling fans draw items toward themselves. Speed and airflow efficiency are affected by how chutes are connected. Aesthetically, chutes can be modified: right-clicking with a wrench adds windows, and non-diagonal chutes can be visually upgraded by encasing them with industrial iron blocks.",
